# SOD1_alanine_mutagenesis
This repository contains all the input files to reproduce our results successfully and the analyzed data is also provided.
1. Amber input files used for creating topology and structure, running minimization, equilibration, and production are provided with extension .in. same files are used for all the simulations.
2. Topology and structure generated through tleap are also provided with extension .prmtop and .inpcrd, respectively.
3. Metal ion parameters which were generated through the MCPB tool of AMBER, are provided. They an have extension .mol2.
4. Analyzed data are provided.
5. Analysis scripts used for generating free energy plots and native contact analysis are available.

Note: the data is provided only for the four mutants i.e. H71A, R79A, D125A, and S134A. Further, data and information can be provided upon request.
